Sirve para agrupar una serie de líneas de código que han sido concebidas para solucionar un problema específico. Una vez la función ha sido programada correctamente, es decir que resuelve el problema retornando la salida esperada para unas entradas dadas, se convierte en un bloque más complejo que se puede reutilizar en otros programas. La función trabaja como si fuera una nueva instrucción del lenguaje que es capaz de realizar una tarea un poco más compleja que las instrucciones que tenía antes. Lo ideal con las funciones es compartir y distribuir estas para un uso generalizado de la solución. \n","\n","En síntesis una función es una caja que tiene unas __entradas__, las cuales son procesadas para producir una __salida__. En la mayoría de situaciones el interés es simplemente como se puede usar la función, para lo cual solo se requiere el nombre, entradas (parámetros de la función) y salida (valor de retorno de la función).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HXGy_2psolGb"},"source":["## Crear una función\n","\n","Para crear una función en pyhthon se sigue la siguiente sintaxis:\n","\n","\n","```python\n","def nombre_funcion(parametro1, parametro2, ..., parametroN):\n","    linea1\n","    linea2\n","    ...\n","    lineaM\n","    return valor\n","```\n","En el esquema de función se identifican las siguientes partes:\n","* __def__: es la palabra reservada de python para declarar una función, siempre tiene que escribirse. \n","* __nombre_funcion__: es un nombre válido que el programador quiera darle a la función para poderla usar en el futuro. Válido, es que no sea una palabra reservada, no sea vacia, no inicie con número o caracter especial. \n","* __parametros__: la lista de parámetros son las entradas de la función. Estas pueden ser una cantidad fija o variable, incluso puede no haber. Los parámetros pueden ser opcionales u obligatorios. Los parametros se escriben dentro de paréntesis redondos y se termina la línea con dos puntos ':'\n","* __lineas__: las líneas representan a las líneas de código que se requieren para resolver el problema dado a la función. Pueden ser tantas como se necesiten. En este bloque, el cual debe llevar un nivel de sangria más, pueden ser llamadas otras funciones que esten definidas, incluso, se puede llamar la función a si misma.\n","* __return__: es la palabra reservada en python para indicar que el valor de la salida ya fue calculado y que ya termina la función. Esta palabra no es requerida, pueden haber funciones que no tiene valor de salida. \n","* __valor__: es una variable que generalmente se crea dentro de la función y que se utiliza como la salida o el resultado de la función.\n","\n","### Ejemplo:\n","\n","\n","```python\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","def saludo_actual():\n","    print('hola mundo: ', datetime.now())\n","```\n","En este ejemplo se escribe una función sin entradas ni salidas, lo que hace simplemente es mostrar un saludo junto con la fecha y hora actual.\n","\n","notas de interés\n","* Para mostrar la fecha y hora actual dentro de la función se usa otra función llamada __now()__ y que está dentro de la librería llamada _datetime_, la cual se debe importar para que la función la reconozca. \n","* Tenga en cuenta que la definición de la función no significa que se ejecute. Por tanto se debe llamar la función de manera correcta en el bloque de código explícitamente.
